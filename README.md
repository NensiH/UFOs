We successfully created a page that aesthetically displays our data while also doing so in a user-friendly way through easy and simple filters. The page is clean, and organized in a user-friendly way.

On the webpage you can scroll through the table to see all of the different UFO sightings or you can use the filters on the left side. These filters allow you to filter the table by the date, city, state, country, or shape of UFO seen. One or multiple filters can be used and all filter parameters can be entered simultaneously.

To reset the filter, the user has two choices. User can either clear input manually by deleting input cell or click the refresh button UFO Sightings that can be found at the top left corner of the page on the navbar. After the filter is cleared, the user can use filter again.

### Link to UFO Sightings webpage
The deployed webpage is accessible at https://nensih.github.io/UFOs/.

## Summary
Overall, the webpage is clean and visually appealing. The site opens with an intersting article and visitors are given several options to filter on for UFO sightings.

The drawback of this design are:

  1. Filters would be more easier to use if there were drop-down menus availabe for all search box.
  2. It would be easy for user, if Reset/clear filter button would be closer to filter parameters table.
